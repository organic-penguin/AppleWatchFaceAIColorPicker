# AppleWatchFaceAIColorPicker (Beta)

</span>

## Overview
This is a collection of tools that can either be setup to run with GitHub Pages or as a local web server for analyzing your daily outfit and choosing the primary color of your shirt

## Installation

### Local Web Server Version (Recommended)
This version hosts a local web server that executes the camera, analysis, and results all locally. This is the most efficient version which uses an Apple Watch shortcut to initialize the camera, take a photo, analyze, retrieve the results, and change the watch face in one efficient shortcut.

#### Clone and Make the Package
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/organic-penguin/AppleWatchFaceAIColorPicker.git` from your RaspberryPi
2. Change directories into the newly created folder - `cd AppleWatchFaceAIColorPicker`
3. Run the make file configuration for the local web server installation - `make local_web`

#### Apple Watch Shortcut
1. Download the 'Change Your Face WEB' shortcut to your iPhone
QR:
2. Adjust the shortcut with the approrpaite local hostname link and map your watch faces to the available colors

### GitHub Version
This version uses a physical button to execute the camera, analysis, and push the results to a GitHub repo page. The Apple Watch shortcut will then have to be executed to retrieve the results from the GitHub page and change your watch face.

`$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`
